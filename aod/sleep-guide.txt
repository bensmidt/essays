“I’ll sleep when I’m dead”
— Warren Zevon

The Most Important Activity You’ll Ever Do
------------------------------------------
Although Warren Zevon is credited with the quote above, its sentiment is one many of us have not only heard but abide by ourselves. The rise of hustle culture and the hyper-connectivity of the internet have produced a society that values “busyness” as a status symbol. The busier one is, we assume, the more important they must be.
And the ultimate claim to busyness?

“You got six hours of sleep? I haven’t slept more than five hours in the last week!”
Despite our society pushing us to “do more” by sleeping less, the science of sleep clearly points to the idea that sleep isn’t optional, it’s vital.

Here are just a few of the drawbacks of sleeping less
1.	Learning: Without sleep, your ability to focus is dismantled, diminishing your ability to process and understand new information.
2.	Memory: Sleep is the backbone of memory. Without sleep, your brain’s ability to create new memories is reduced to a fraction of its normal capabilities.
3.	Weight Gain: Lack of sleep increases hunger levels, reduces feelings of satiety and produces cravings for carbohydrates.
4.	Athletic Performance: Sleep less than eight hours a night (particularly less than six) and time to physical exhaustion drops by 10 to 30 percent (check out NBA player Andre Iguodala’s performance with and without eight hours of sleep).
5.	Anxiety: Sleep deprivation is strongly correlated to increased levels of anxiety (general mental health suffers from lack of sleep as well).
6.	Emotional Regulation: Sleep plays a key role in emotional regulation; it’s theorized that sleep is critical to daily emotional processing and dealing with trauma.

So what else is affected by sleep? This question, while intuitive, is simply the wrong question. The real question is: what isn’t affected by sleep? Every major organ in your body, every action you complete on a day-to-day basis, and even your daily mood are all significantly impacted by your sleep.

And if science isn’t enough to convince you of the importance of sleep, here’s what a few successful individuals have to say about a good night’s rest.

“Eight hours of sleep makes a big difference for me, and I try hard to make that a priority. For me, that’s the needed amount to feel energized and excited.”
— Jeff Bezos

“I like to get seven hours of sleep a night because that’s what I need to stay sharp and creative and upbeat.”
— Bill Gates

If these ultra-successful individuals, with unfathomable demands on their time, can prioritize seven to eight hours of sleep a night, there’s no excuse for you not to as well.

Sleep Duration
--------------
We’ve all heard we need eight hours of sleep. Yet, somehow we convince ourselves we’ve won the genetic lottery and only need six. To be quite frank, the likelihood of this is so low it might as well be impossible.

Please. Stop lying to yourself.

To identify if you’re currently obtaining enough sleep, Matthew Walker, a professor at UC Berkeley and author of Why We Sleep, suggests this rule of thumb. Simply ask yourself these two questions:
1.	Could you fall back asleep at 10 or 11 AM?
2.	Can you function optimally without caffeine before noon?
If you answered yes to the first question or no to the second one, either your sleep quantity and/or quality is insufficient. You need more sleep.
Humans need a minimum of seven hours of sleep a night. This means you need to be in bed for at least seven hours and fifteen minutes (if not thirty) to allow yourself time to fall asleep. Although, ideally you’d be in bed for eight hours to allow for a full night’s rest.
 
Chronotype: What is it?
-----------------------
According to the Sleep Foundation, your Chronotype is “the natural inclination of your body to sleep at a certain time.” Best exemplified by the difference between teenagers and adults, individuals naturally fall asleep and wake up at different times of the day.
This is completely normal but it has important ramifications. If your body’s natural sleep rhythm is 12 AM to 8 AM but you keep trying to wake yourself up at 5 AM every day, your quality of sleep will suffer.

While your chronotype does shift as you progress through life and can be altered, it’s important to try to stick to your chronotype as closely as possible. To identify your chronotype you can take this online quiz created by Michael Breus, PhD, author of The Power of When.

Improving Your Sleep Quality
----------------------------
If you could only do one thing to improve your sleep, this piece of advice would produce the most benefit: fall asleep and wake up at a consistent time. This doesn’t mean “around midnight” every day. I literally mean go to bed at exactly 11 PM and wake up at exactly 7 AM every day (or whatever eight-hour span your chronotype fits into).
To many of us, falling asleep at the same time every day seems massively inconvenient with such high demands on our time. Paradoxically though, prioritizing sleep will actually provide you more time, not less. Concentration and productivity improve dramatically, allowing you to achieve more in the same number of hours (or even less). Once you start prioritizing sleep, don’t be surprised to have extra downtime despite spending more hours in bed.

A warranted concern regarding a consistent sleep schedule is the weekend. After a long week, falling asleep at 11 PM on a Friday is the last thing any of us wants to do. I get it, trust me. And to be quite frank, it’s unreasonable for me to ask you to fall asleep at such a time (especially considering I don't do this myself). You need to enjoy life too.

What I will ask you to do though is find a consistent sleep schedule Sunday night through Friday morning and still try to sleep eight hours (or more!) on the weekends. Even if you’re falling asleep at a much later time than your regular weekday schedule, hopefully it isn’t too much later (like 4 or 5 hours later). While it isn’t perfect, it’s a good enough middle ground and likely a huge improvement from your current sleep schedule.
 
A Few More Tips for Improving Sleep Quality
-------------------------------------------
1.	View (bright) sunlight for ten minutes within an hour of waking up.
2.	Sleep at ~65 degrees Fahrenheit.
3.	Sleep in pitch dark.

I won’t detail the science behind these tips too much but know they are effective as well as fairly easy to implement.

Viewing bright light sets your circadian rhythm, tuning your internal clock to fall asleep and wake up at the proper time. Snuggling up under your covers in the neighborhood of 65 degrees Fahrenheit has been shown to be the optimal temperature (don’t be afraid to increase or decrease the temperature several degrees to find the best temperature for you though). And finally, sleeping in pitch dark ensures no ambient light interrupts your circadian rhythm. For this last tip, purchasing blackout shades or a sleep mask are a worthy investment.

Worst Sleep Practices
---------------------
Implementing the advice above is critical to improving your sleep quality. But it might all be for nothing if you consistently damage your sleep with the following three practices.
1.	Drinking alcohol before going to bed.
2.	Drinking caffeine after 2 PM.
3.	Viewing bright light, especially blue light from your screens, before sleeping.

Alcohol is a Sedative, Not a Sleep Aid
--------------------------------------
Contrary to popular belief, alcohol does not aid sleep. In fact, alcohol is a sedative, meaning it sedates you into falling asleep. Once asleep though, alcohol hinders sleep quality in two major ways.

The first issue with alcohol is that it fragments sleep. While you often don’t realize or can’t recall from the night before, alcohol causes you to wake up many times throughout the night resulting in extremely nonrestorative sleep. This effect is partially responsible for why you feel so drowsy and fatigued the day after drinking.

Alcohol’s next big issue is that it heavily suppresses REM sleep, a critical portion of a good night’s rest. Without REM sleep we severely hamper learning, memory, and mood (among other things). This is particularly concerning if you’re a student or someone trying to learn large amounts of information and/or gain a new skill set.

Cut the Caffeine
----------------
Unbeknownst to many, caffeine has an average half-life of five hours, meaning if you drink caffeine at 6 PM half of it will still be in your bloodstream at 11 PM. As I’m sure you already know, caffeine’s superpower is waking you up and keeping you awake.
This is fine in the morning, but has detrimental effects on one’s circadian rhythm and sleep quality when trying to fall asleep at night. It takes roughly ten hours for caffeine to clear your system so drinking caffeine after 2 PM (assuming you fall asleep at midnight) will disrupt your sleep to varying extents.

The Damaging Effects of Blue Light
----------------------------------
Similar to how viewing bright light in the morning sets your circadian rhythm, viewing bright light (particularly blue light) at night signals to your brain it’s still daytime. This disrupts your circadian rhythm and destroys sleep quality.

What’s more, you shouldn’t be looking at bright light for two to three hours before bed. If you’re like me and can’t simply turn off your screens that long before sleeping, consider investing in some blue light glasses (make sure they’re tinted orange or red, not clear). Check out this website for more tips on managing blue light before sleep if you’re interested.
 
 
Sleep’s Best Kept Secret: Naps
------------------------------
“Visit cultures that are untouched by electricity and you often see something rather different. Hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Gabra in northern Kenya or the San people in the Kalahari Desert, whose way of life has changed little over the past thousands of years, sleep in a biphasic pattern.”
— Matthew Walker

To sleep biphasically, as Walker put it, means to consistently sleep in two bouts of sleep a day. For us humans, that typically means seven to eight hours of sleep at night and a 30 to 60-minute nap in the middle of the day.

Despite what many of us may think of naps, they aren’t just an invention to give kindergarten teachers a much-needed break. Naps are intrinsic to our biology and have been around for as long as history itself. If you’ve ever felt that early afternoon lull in energy, that’s your body begging you for a quick power nap.

There’s good reason not to brush aside that drowsy feeling. Research studies show naps provide a host of benefits including improved productivity, increased memory retention, reduced stress levels, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and more.

While there are many different ways to nap, a twenty-minute power nap before 2 PM (so you don’t disrupt your ability to fall asleep later that night) provides tremendous value for relatively little investment in time. Similar to sleeping at night, napping at the same time every day produces the best sleep quality.
