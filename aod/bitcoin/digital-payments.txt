To be upfront with you, I didn't write this article because I’m chiefly interested in the US banking system. In fact, my chief interest in digital payments is that they work well enough for me to buy my groceries, pay my rent, and grab an occasional Caniac combo on particularly lousy days.

Surprisingly though, I managed to spend a small sum of time learning the basics in an effort better understand the world of Bitcoin. That’s right, this article was supposed to be a part of a different article I wrote on Bitcoin, which you can CHECK OUT HERE after finishing this one. However, I quickly realized it needed its own article to be thoroughly explained, which is why you’re now reading an article about digital payments (Woohoo!). 

Okay, jokes aside, don’t let my personal lack of enthusiasm for this topic discourage you. Understanding the process proved quite beneficial and more intriguing than I previously thought. I even drove to see my regional Federal Reserve Bank. I know, I’m a changed man. Anyways let’s get to the goods. 

Same Banks
----------
To make this explanation simpler for both of us, I’ll use two hypothetical individuals, Bob and Carol. They both live in Ohio and it's currently January. 
One cold winter’s day, Bobby finds himself needing a cheap coat and wind’s up at Carol’s thrift store, Carol’s Clothing. He manages to find a beautiful coat for $8 and is now standing at the cash register ready to pay. 

Let’s first consider Bobby paying in cash. If Bobby hands Carol $8 cash, Carol can trust the $8 (whether Bobby is trustworthy or not is of no consequence) and she accordingly gives Bobby his newly purchased coat.
Institutional Bookkeepers

Instead of cash though, let’s consider Bobby paying with a debit card. Since digital assets are just information stored in a computer somewhere, and thus extremely easy to duplicate, how can Carol trust Bobby’s digital payment? She doesn’t trust Bobby, that’s for sure. But she does trust his bank, a third party that manages and records all digital transactions between entities.

Assuming Carol’s Clothing and Bobby bank at the same institution, when Bobby pays Carol, the bank simply moves $8 from Bobby’s account into the account for Carol’s Clothing. Bobby’s account decreases by $8, Carol’s Clothing increases by $8, and the bank simply transferred money internally so it neither gains nor loses money.
Without physical money, which can’t be easily replicated, banks operate as a crucial third party to digital money. Their role as a bookkeeper is vital to ensure no one is spending the same digital $8 multiple times. And our ability to trust banks as honest bookkeepers, or at least trust the government that regulates them, is equally important to ensure our digital money operates in the same manner as physical money. $1 of digital money must provide $1 of value, just like physical money. No double-spending.

The Central Bank
----------------
You might be wondering what happens if Bobby and Carol’s Clothing bank at different institutions, which is fairly common. While there are a couple of different routes money can take, the most used (and most important to understand) is the Federal Reserve System (the Fed for short).

All banks can hold an account with the Fed in the same manner that individuals hold accounts at regular banks. They then use the Fed as a middle man to transfer money amongst themselves. Let’s see how this works with Bobby’s bank being Bank A and Carol’s Clothing’s bank being Bank B.

Bobby’s bank, Bank A, transfers $8 of Bobby’s money from his account in Bank A to Bank A’s account with the Fed. The Fed then transfers that $8 from Bank A’s account with the Fed to Bank B’s account with the Fed. Finally, bank B transfers the $8 from their account with the Fed to Carol’s Clothing’s account with Bank B.
 
Of course, this process holds various complexities and intricacies but this covers the gist of how digital money moves through our economy. It relies solely on centralized institutions to record transactions and ensure everyone spends only as much as they have.
