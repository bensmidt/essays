Some special individuals have a unique charm about them. They walk into a room and people immediately gravitate their way. It’s difficult to place but something about them is just…magnetics. 

In the same vein, other individuals . Something about their energy is just… off. Being in the same room feels like attending a funeral. 

While many would say i

I read Dale Carnegie’s famous book, How to Win Friends and Influence People. Here are the most important lessons I learned. 
Everyone Needs to Feel Important

“Everyone wants to feel important.”
 — Dale Carnegie

At first glance, this idea seems far too obvious to have any impact on how we converse with others. Yet, closer attention not only reveals the far-reaching implications of this idea but our inability to execute on them as well. 

Why We Need to Feel Important
-----------------------------
Let’s start big. Every great leader, every creative thinker, every genius inventor can largely attribute their motivation for their accomplishments to their desire to feel important. 

I realize that statement seems overdramatic so let me backtrack a bit to explain. Humans are extremely social creatures and we have an innate desire to not only improve our own lives but to improve the lives of our community as well (especially the people we know and love). 

This can be explained by our evolutionary need for community. Before civilizations were built, humans lived in small bands. Surviving alone was impossible. The only reasonable way to ensure the survival of oneself and one’s family was to be a part of a small community. As such, humans evolved to be extremely social and developed a deep-seated desire to be significant and useful in their communities. 

Impact On the Modern World
--------------------------
While this desire is no longer important to our survival, it still plays a vital role in our daily lives. In the modern world, our desire to be significant manifests in a variety of ways. From garnering more likes on our Instagram posts to pursuing world-changing endeavors like ending world hunger, the root desire is the same. 
We need to feel useful, helpful, or significant in our community. It’s baked into our biology. 

For some, this manifests in a drive to improve their community (or even the whole world) in some capacity. Others attempt to attain high status, wealth, or fame. And yet still, others take unethical routes in an attempt to become infamous figures in their community. 

The need to feel important is a core aspect of what it means to be human. What separates us within this need is how we choose to fulfill it. If you can identify the manner in which individuals want to feel significant, you can (partially) fill that need for them. And, they’ll love you for it. 

Put Yourself in Other’s Shoes
-----------------------------
“Treat others as you would want to be treated”
The golden rule. A statement as cliche as they come. Personally, I’m not a big fan of the golden rule. Not because I don’t agree with the basic sentiment, I just think it lacks clarity of meaning. 

A clearer version of the golden rule might be something like
“Treat others as you think they would want to be treated”

Maybe this idea is obvious to you but it was quite novel to me. For many years I generally assumed that my wants and needs were relatively the same as anyone else's. As long as I treated others as I would want to be treated, everything would work out splendidly. 

As I’ve learned though, this often isn’t the case. While we all have some common core desires, they manifest in very distinct ways. With different genetics, varying life experiences, and distinct views of the world, we often value and yearn for quite different, and even opposing, things. 

With this in mind, the ability to empathize and imagine yourself in another’s shoes stands as one of the most important (if not the most important) skill in dealing with people. Empathy grants you the master key to understanding others’ needs and wants. 
Of course, this is only half the puzzle. You still need to follow through on this knowledge and actively provide for others. And you must do so in a sincere and well-intentioned manner. If your only goal in empathizing with someone is to get something out of them, they will sense your insincerity and your plan will backfire. On the other hand, if you habitualize empathy and provide for others with a genuine interest in their well-being, you will soon find the same being done for you as a token of others’ appreciation. 

Everyone is Your Superior
-------------------------
“In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn of him.” 
 — Ralph Waldo Emerson 

Insecurity 
----------
Insecurity constantly tugs at our hearts, reminding us of our perceived deficiencies. Although people feel it in various degrees, insecurity is a universal and inescapable feeling. 

Our defense mechanism against insecurity is quite peculiar though. When feeling insecure around others, our gut reaction often isn’t to reaffirm ourselves or think about our redeeming qualities. Instead, many of us focus on the deficiencies we see in others, attempting to “raise ourselves up” by putting others down. 

While understandable, this practice is quite damaging. Focusing on the deficiencies of others reduces your view of them, provides no substance to elevate your view of yourself, and reinforces thoughts that everyone else is judging you just as much (if not more) as you’re judging them. 

Reframe Your Point of View
--------------------------
The antidote? Reframe your point of view. Understand that we all have varying skill sets suited for different contexts. To compare yourself to others is pointless for no other reason than that it’s impossible. What metric makes someone “better” or “more valuable”? 

The answer to that question might show you what you value, but you cannot give an accurate answer for everyone on the planet. As we’ve already established, people have very distinct ideas of what they value and why. The only person you can accurately assess yourself against is you. 

Keeping this idea in mind allows you to stop focusing on the deficiencies of others and start truly appreciating their redeeming qualities without feeling jealous. That last part is key. We’re often jealous of the redeeming qualities of others. This, however natural it may feel, is nonsensical and destroys relationships. 

There are few qualities and skills (mostly physical attributes) that can never be learned, overcome, or at least improved to some degree. As such, your greatest asset in trying to attain a skillset, knowledge base, trait, etc. is the person who’s better at it than you.
