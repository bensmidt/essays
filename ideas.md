### What are some common things to find meaning/purpose which leave you empty?

**Power**- chasing power will either leave you in failure or world domination. Either way I don't want power because responsibilty is a bitch. There’s also a shit ton of other things that go along with power that I don’t want at all. Thus, I shall not explain the rest of this. 

**Success**- Just look at the identity reason, it's essentially the same

**Material Things**- same as most things, you can simply never get enough

**"Enjoying the Moment"; Partying**- while partying is fun and the memories you make are invuable you can't live for this because it has no long term payoff and thus will leave you empty. Partying as your purpose is like choosing one marshmallow a day over getting nothing for 5 years and then getting a car. That analogy is pretty shit but you still get the point. With partying all you get is the moment and maybe some friends. You should still party and have fun but my point is that you should other things you focus on besides partying because partying only has short-term payoff. Prime example is people who peak in high school or college.

# What are some common things to put one's identity and confidence in that will fail you?

**Beauty**- an extremely common thing for one to put one's identity/ confidence in, and rightfully so. Being good looking is extremely helpful in the world and gives great advantages for seemingly no reason. However, beauty is clearly a fading attribute as it will disappear with time. If you put your confidence in this, then you will attract people who like you for your beauty. Thus when your beauty begins to fade, not only will your confidence dissipate, but you will find many of your "friends" less loyal or simply not as interestedin hanging out with you. 

**Power**- After acheiving power, one develops a power complex. By basing your worth in power, the only manner in which you can be fully confident is by having the most power in the room. If this isn't achieved, one's confidence is threatened and insecurities will follow as you will want to hold power of the person of higher authority. 

**Intelligence**- this is the most difficult one for me as I've always prided myself on my academic achievement and prowess. However, intelligence, while it might not fade like beauty, is also a fools thing to put your confidence in. Similar to power, if you aren't the most intelligent one in the room at all times, you fill find your identity and your confidence threatened. 

**Success**- Success is in an interesting one. It's hard to define and even harder to acheive, unless your standards are low. That's besides the point though. Acheiving things for the sake of acheiving them, gaining money, grabbing power, being wealthy, etc. (these are common definitions of success) all lead you to the same place: you will simply want more success as there is never an "end" to how successful you can become. And even if there was, would acheiving it actually be that satisfying? (Once you got to your "success", would you be totally satisfied for the rest of your life? I would argue no and thus you would just keep chasing different meanings of success only to find yourself in the same cycle of achieving things, none of which give you absolute satisfaction.)

**Money**- By placing your identity in money, one confines themselves to material possessions and will constantly be chasing the next biggest thing and the next payday only to eventuallly find that it's a never ending cycle of obtaining things. Eventually, nothing will satisfy ones desire for more material possessions (even temporarily) and the person will either assume they need to make more money, which is again a fool's errand, or they will simply find themselves feeling bare inside as all the things they spent so much time on obtaining and using have faded and no longer hold meaning. 

**Fame**- I would hate to be famous in the first place so I don't even feel like explaining this one. Check popularity argument though because they're pretty similar. 

**Popularity**- We'll define popularity as being in good standing with a large number of people. By *chasing* popularity you essentially become a people pleaser because the only way you can be in good standing with a lot of people is by molding your personality to fit with other people's personalities or what other people expect you to act like. By constantly shifting your personality to fit others, you definitionally lose your own inherent identity and you will thus find youself lost in the never ending cycle of molding yourself to others. By basing you own identity in this you will assuredly lose yourself and find that you're doing things for the people around you instead of yourself (to a fault; it's good to help others, it is not good to give others power over personal decisions that ultimately have no real effect on them). 

**An important note for almost all of these is that none of these are inherently bad things and are even things that are good or necessary. However, it is when your identity becomes these things that these things will fail you and leave you empty or disappointed. They may last for awhile, even years, but eventually they will fade and the satisfaction you once felt will no longer be apparent.**

# What are some things that you should put your identity and confidence in?

**Character**- One of the few things (maybe the only one) in life that is worth placing your confidence in is good character because you constanty choose to live or act a certain way and there is (theoretically at least) nothing in this world that can stop you from doing so. While things mentioned from the previous question are things that either require a certain age, mobility, energy, or simply the opinions of other people to achieve, having good character is wholly independent. Thus, it is something worth putting your identity and confidence in because it is unshakable ground. Now, notice that I'm not saying that this is something that gives life intrinsic meaning or purpose, I'm saying that it is something that we can build our lives upon that will never disappear unless we allow it to. This combined with the fruitfullness of having good character make it something worth focusing on, improving upon, and basing one's confidence in.

# What are some things that you think might have intrinsic meaning or purpose, but you're unsure?

**True Love/ Soulmate**- Similar to forming deep relationships with others, forming an unbreakable bond with one person in this world is a feeling that is truly like no other. It is a feeling of closeness and vulnerability that I believe might be impossible to achieve with anyone other than your partner. The knowledge that someone can know you so intimately and absolutely love you for who you are, faults and all, fulfills a core need of being loved and accepted to a degree that I believe is unable to be found in or through anyone or anything else in the world (a single exception is god, although this is predicated on his existence which is a whole different matter).

**Religion**- This is a common one for a lot of people but the main issue **for me** is that it absolutely must be true **for me** to believe it. With this being said however, it is possible (and I think it is a true facet of reality) that believing in god (or whatever religion) can give you meaning regardless of whether it is true or not. Similar to the debate about if there is an inherent reality or if everyone's reality is simply in their own head, if one wholly believes that their purpose and needs are fully met through a religion that doesn't exist, it would still give that person intrinsic meaning in their life. It is not the reality of the religion that gives the meaning, but the unshakable belief by the person that their religion exists which creates a placebo reality that gives that specific person their own meaning. Hopefully that makes sense lol. 

**Excitement**- this is an idea that I grabbed from Tim Ferris, but I'm leaning toward a no on this one. The premise is that we all think we are chasing happiness, but what we are actually chasing is excitement. We want to do things, have things, and be things that fullfill our desires but obviously we can't maintain a constant with these (you can only get a new car at one point in time. you can't spread that feeling of getting a new car over a long period of time. It fades). Thus it is not happiness that we are chasing, but excitement. Another way to think about this is to ponder the feeling of being bored, which Ferris argues is the true nemisis of life. The thing we despise the most is being bored or dull. Thus, to combat this we need to find the opposite, which is not happiness but excitement. It's an interesting idea, but seems to me to be a flawed one because it takes the "high" of getting new things, doing new things, etc. on a platter and make it an essential part of your way of living. Excitement in and of itself is a good thing and should even be something everyone should chase to an extent. However, if it becomes your life goal I think you might find yourself feeling empty as nothing can truly satisfy your need for excitement and the chase becomes similar to that of money and material wealth.

# What are some things that, if they are neglected, will have serious negative effects on your life? (Either now and in the future)

Close Relationships- People have an inherent need to be close to others. It is a necessity that can't be neglected. Not having relationships with people will have damaging effects on one's mental health. 

Exercise (Components of Physical Fitness)- This one's pretty obvious since we live in America but lack of exercise will lead to a less than desirable body, negative health effects,  and missed opportunity for improving mental health

Diet- Similar to exercise. Bad diet results in negative health effects, undesirable looks, poor discipline, 

Sleep- look at the whole reseatch section on sleep; there's a lot lmao

There's a good chance your life has absolutely no purpose or significance in the grand scheme of things
