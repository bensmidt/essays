The clearest example of how much we lack forethought in our lives is our culture’s infatuation with efficiency. We love to increase our efficiency by scaling output, cutting production times, lowering costs, etc. The concreteness of the improvement (“4% faster than yesterday!”) gives us tangible feelings of improvement.

What many of us fail to consider is this: does this activity even matter? You can be 50x faster, produce 10x more, cut costs by 90%; but if the activity isn’t of the utmost importance, then it’s a waste of time. If you aren’t doing the activities that provide the highest contribution toward your goals, then who cares how efficient you are, you’re completely ineffective.

A quick example should provide clarity to this idea. Imagine it’s 1970 and you’re in Houston to see an Astros game with a few friends. Since Steve Jobs is only 15 at this point, y’all are stuck using an old-fashioned paper map. You meander around for a while but don’t make much progress. After another hour or so, you and your friends are quite frustrated as the map doesn’t make any sense.

You begin to drive faster. You hand the map to your friends and have two of them read it simultaneously. You even turn the radio off to help you concentrate on where you’re going. After another hour you’re no closer to finding the stadium and the game starts in 30 minutes. Panic begins to set in.

In a last-ditch effort, you stop at a local restaurant and ask for directions. Upon handing your map to the waitress, she gives you a puzzled look and politely tells you this isn’t a map of Houston. It’s a map of Chicago.

Ah, and therein lies the problem. Many of us are so busy driving faster, reducing distractions, and putting in extra effort to read the map, we never consider the idea that we’re using the wrong map. This is the core difference between efficiency and effectiveness. While efficiency is doing things faster, effectiveness is doing what matters most.

And the truth is, most of us are unbelievably ineffective.
