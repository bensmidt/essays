I’ve played organized basketball since roughly the age of seven. From club basketball as a youngster to starting on my high school varsity squad, I’ve roughly a decade of experience. My expertise? Shooting.

Now, keeping that in mind, I was recently at the rec playing basketball with a few friends. One game was particularly competitive and, after a little trash talk, my roommate bet me $10 I couldn’t make more three-pointers than him. 10 shots later, I was $10 richer.

I could’ve stopped there, but my ego doubled down and bet him $20 I could sink two out of ten threes blindfolded. The result? 0–10. I lost my initial winnings and was now stuck funding my friends’ double chicken bowl at Chipotle later that night.
Pretty stupid bet, I know.

How can you make a shot when you don’t even know where you’re aiming?
Well, that is the question, isn't it? Although seemingly obvious in hindsight, many of us make the same mistake in life. We imagine our future, planning what car we’ll drive, the locations of our second homes, how massive our yacht will be, etc. We’re so dazzled with the thought of success, we forget to define it. In our haste to fulfill our dreams, we don’t take the time to clarify what it would mean to achieve them, let alone the best path to get there.
 
Passion
-------
Many people have a vague idea of what they think they want to do. But oftentimes their life direction arises from a comment a friend or mentor gave them. A simple, “Wow! You really have a knack for physics!” is enough to convince many people they should major in engineering with the justification that they’d “probably be good at”.

To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with discovering your passion in a trivial manner. However, many of us take the wrong approach to finding direction in life.

Imagine you’re at a buffet. And not just any buffet. And endless buffet with so endless variety and infinite options. Given the chance to eat at such a buffet, you would take your sweet time deciding what to order, wouldn’t you?

You’d probably walk around a bit, survey the options, maybe taste test a few dishes, etc. After exploring you’d have only a small list of foods worthy enough of your taste buds. With so much to choose from, you can’t waste your time with trivial foods like salad or a sandwich. You want Sushi! Steak! Lobster! Cheesecake!

Although this process is intuitive at a buffet, most of us do the opposite in our own lives. With infinitely many possibilities, we quickly become overwhelmed. Instead of surveying life’s options, taste testing the most intriguing ones and making an educated choice, we let others’ opinions and suggestions guide our decisions.

Don’t forget, you can choose what you want to do in life. But you must first explore your options to find your favorite. You might think you could eat only pizza for the rest of your life but you don’t know until you try. Finding your passion(s) requires some long-term experience. You can’t simply read about it, or watch others do it, or enjoy fantasizing about it. The only way to know whether you’ll enjoy spending decades of your life doing something is to go do it.
 
For practical steps on how to explore your curiosities and cultivate them into full-blown passions, check out this article by Steven Kotler which details “The Passion Recipe”. Alternatively, if you have the time to put in a little more effort, his book The Art of Impossible: A Peak Performance Primer provides an in-depth explanation for finding your passion, linking it to a greater purpose, and achieving the impossible.

Goals
-----
While exploring allows us to discover our calling, goals are how we execute. Without goals, transferring our imagination’s ideas into reality is about as likely as me making a three-pointer blindfolded.
Right. Essentially none.

Goals work because they give us focus. By setting proper goals, you provide clarity as to what’s important in your life and what isn’t. This allows you to filter out anything that doesn’t directly contribute to your goals. Whenever an opportunity arises, you compare it to your goals and see if it's a perfect match. If not, more opportunities will come. If so, you just took another big step toward achieving your goals.
By filtering your time with your goals, you inadvertently concentrate your energy on the activities that propel you the farthest the fastest. This, of course, enhances your growth immensely. By focusing your efforts on activities that matter most, you can produce 3x, 5x, and even 10x more.

Mission Statement
-----------------
Setting goals is difficult. While a well-thought-out goal produces success, poorly written goals propel failure. If your goal lacks a strong “why”, fails to adequately describe the finish line, is too ambitious, or is too easy (just to name a few common pitfalls), your goal will do more harm than good.
A great place to start with setting goals is to craft a personal mission statement. Writing a sentence or two that describes your overarching purpose gives clarity to your goals. While your goals may be distinct from each other, using your mission statement as a guide ensures they harmonize to achieve your chosen purpose.
A good example of a mission statement is from Steven Kotler’s The Art of Impossible. Although he uses the term “Massive Transformative Purpose” instead of mission statement, the idea is essentially the same. His mission statement example is “to discover sustainable solutions to end world hunger”.
Keeping in mind Kotler’s aim is in achieving the impossible, your mission statement doesn’t necessarily need to be quite so grandiose (although it certainly can and should be if you’re willing to do so). Regardless though, your mission statement should hold the same general form. It should be simple, concise, provide clarity, and (most importantly) matter deeply to you.
Whether it’s on a local or global level, make sure your mission statement is directed toward helping others and solving a serious issue. You may think “to be the richest man in the world” is your life’s purpose, but life’s meaning is derived from building and giving to others, not fulfilling personal desires.
An important note is that your massive transformative purpose requires deep exploration as well. Similar to discovering your passion, pinpointing an issue that resonates deeply with you requires research into various issues, deep thinking, and serious reflection. Your mission statement will be guiding much of your life decisions for the long-term if not your entire life. Be sure it’s something that matters to you.
 
 
SMART Goals
-----------
After exploring life’s activities to find the few you’re most passionate about and crafting a well-thought-out mission statement aimed at improving the lives of others, it’s time to create concrete goals.

Before moving forward, it’s worth mentioning that the exploration process of finding your passions and purpose will take time, possibly a year or two. Don’t rush. Nail these the first time or you’ll find yourself restarting after losing motivation for activities you “love doing” or issues you care “so deeply” for.

Anyways, from here we’ll leave behind the vagueness of finding passions and purpose, and become extremely clear about how to accomplish them. To do this we’ll apply the SMART goal-setting model to two types of goals: high-hard goals and clear goals (both of which are from Kotler’s The Art of Impossible).

The SMART goal-setting model is simple. Your goals need to be:
1.	Specific: What do you want to accomplish? Why do you want to accomplish it? Who will be involved in accomplishing it? What resources do you need?
2.	Measurable: How will you know when you’re done?
3.	Achievable: Is your goal realistic? Is it too easy? Too difficult?
4.	Relevant: Does this goal further your mission statement? Does it work in harmony with your other efforts?
5.	Time-Bound: When should you be done with this goal?
 
Crafting Your Goals
-------------------
Applying this framework, let’s begin with high-hard goals. High-hard goals are a set of goals (maybe three) in a 1–5 year timeline that are major stepping stones in furthering your mission statement.

For someone whose mission statement was the example from earlier (discover sustainable solutions to end world hunger), they could obtain a degree in food science, start a non-profit utilizing a sustainable food source, etc. Although your mission statement gives clear direction, imagination and creativity give way to an infinite number of high-hard goals. Deciding which suits you best is where you consult your passions.

Here are a few examples given different passions:
1.	Science/Research: Obtain a master’s degree in food science by May 2023.
2.	Human Relations: Start a non-profit company aimed at discovering sustainable solutions to end world hunger by January 2023.
3.	Finance: Raise $10 million by December 2022 to contribute toward research at X company (whatever company aligns with this goal) aimed at discovering sustainable solutions to end world hunger.

You have unbelievable autonomy in how you choose to fulfill your mission statement. Fulfill your purpose through your passions so you can do what you love knowing its impact is significant to you.

After creating your high-hard goals, it’s time to set clear goals. These goals guide your day-to-day actions and let you know what you should be doing right now to achieve your high-hard goals. For example, if you’re high-hard goal is obtaining a food science degree, a clear goal could be: “send an application to a top university in food science by 4 PM” or “study three hours for Wednesday’s exam by 12 PM”.

Clear goals will likely come in the form of a daily to-do list. However, most to-do lists are developed willy-nilly with no higher sense of purpose. Since clear goals are derived from your high-hard goals, you can be confident your to-do list is directly contributing to your higher purpose. This not only boosts motivation and grit but frees your mind to focus fully on the task at hand. Instead of wondering what you should be doing, you can simply jump full force into your daily to-do list (clear goals), elevating your energy and focus.

One last piece of advice on to-do lists (and just achieving things generally) is to use a schedule. Schedules provide a host of benefits.
