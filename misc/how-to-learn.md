You Don’t Know How to Learn
---------------------------
Like most students, I thought I knew how to learn. And like most students, I was wrong.
For years I brute forced my way through classes, unaware of how much time I was wasting. I assumed learning was merely a function of hard work and intelligence. Those with a higher IQ got more time for watching Avatar: The Last Airbender while the rest of us either slaved away understanding why x = 13 or simply threw up our hands and watched Avatar anyway.

Fortunately, this isn’t how learning works. Learning is a skill. Although it’s unique in that developing your learning ability upgrades your aptitude for acquiring new knowledge and skills. This makes learning a meta-skill, a skill that can be applied to almost any domain of life, including other skills. 
Like any skill—writing, basketball, photography—there are worthless methods for learning as well as powerful ones. Unfortunately for most students, they tend to use the worthless ones.  

Learning Is Difficult
---------------------
The most important information to know is that learning is a function of effort. Your brain (consuming 20% of your daily calories) conserves as much energy as possible. Unless an activity places your brain under considerable strain, your brain assumes the activity is unimportant and discards it from your memory within the next few hours or days. 

Said more bluntly, learning is supposed to be difficult. 
While disappointing, a significant silver lining can be found. Effort is not directly correlated to time. Many low-intensity learning methods, despite taking many hours, produce nearly nothing. On the other hand, a few high-intensity learning methods provide valuable results in a fraction of the time. The catch is, they require energy and focus. 

Discovering the useless learning methods and understanding how to leverage the effective ones is the focus of the rest of this article.    

Ineffective Learning Methods
----------------------------
To begin, let’s talk about the three most common ineffective study (learning) tactics:
1.	Highlighting
2.	Rereading textbook or lecture notes
3.	Practicing all at the same time (massed practice)

For many of us, these practices may come as a surprise. It’s possible you’ve used these tactics since elementary school (I know I did) but have done just fine. While no doubt true, science suggests you’ve been succeeding in spite of your learning habits, not because of them. 

It’s Too Easy
-------------
Speaking of which, you’re probably wondering why these techniques are so ineffective. The most important reason: they’re extremely low difficulty. Highlighting, for instance, simply requires you to move a colored pen over paper with little more than a few seconds of thought about what you’re actually highlighting. Even a 7-year-old can complete such a study technique, which exemplifies the lack of engagement highlighting requires.

You Don’t Understand What You Don’t Understand
----------------------------------------------
The danger of these practices is two-fold though as they also trick you into thinking you understand material far better than you actually do. Take rereading a textbook for example. Textbooks are written in an easily digestible format (boring doesn’t mean difficult) because they’re meant to teach novices about the subject. It’s supposed to be easily understood. As such, assessing how well you know material based on how well you understand the textbook is nonsensical. It results in massively overestimating the depth of your knowledge.

The same general logic can be applied to practicing (or studying) in very large chunks (otherwise known as “massed practice”). When you mass your practice, such as doing your math homework in one sitting every week, you’re repeating the same information or skills in a small window of time. By completing all your practice in one go, you’re momentarily much better at whatever skill you’re practicing since you’re able to hold all the necessary information in your short-term working memory.

This is problematic though considering the majority of that information won’t be retained for longer than the rest of the day. You might initially struggle in your practice but as you continue, you’ll be able to mindlessly keep going. The effects of this are most obvious when you cram for an exam. Yes, you’ll remember enough information for the next day but within 48 hours nearly everything you’ve “learned” mysteriously disappears.

The Best Tools for Better Learning
----------------------------------
With those practices debunked, now it’s time for the real meat and potatoes of effective learning. Although a plethora of tools and techniques abound, a select few have proven to be the cream of the crop:
1.	Active Recall
2.	Spaced Repetition
3.	Interleaving

If one or more of those phrases mean nothing to you, don’t worry. They were hieroglyphics to me too but I promise they’re unbelievably simple tools.

Active Recall
-------------
Let’s begin with active recall, the scientific name for testing. I realize the word test has strong connotations of stress and anxiety for many of us. However, that’s only due to the high-stress environments that exams, SATs, and finals place us in. All testing means is to attempt to solve a set of problems with predefined answers. Some tests are high stakes and therefore quite stressful (SAT, finals, etc.) while others are low stakes and seem like nothing more than a nuisance (practice problems, practice tests, flashcards, etc.). This doesn’t mean the latter aren’t important though! On the contrary, testing is king in the world of learning. The science here is unbelievably clear. If you could choose only one tool for learning, testing rules supreme.

The reasons are many but the main sticking points are these
- Testing is difficult, requiring a high degree of engagement
- Testing provides you an objective measure of what you truly know

One of the real beauties of testing is objective feedback. Objective feedback provides accurate information of your strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to efficiently allocate your time and energy to your largest gaps in understanding. A crucial point about testing though is that the degree of similarity between how you test yourself when learning and how you’ll be tested is of great significance. The higher the degree of similarity, the better your testing, as a learning tool, will prepare you. This is most clearly seen when students taking the SAT improve their scores simply by taking practice SATs. The more practice exams one completes, (generally) the more their score improves.
 
 
Spaced Repetition
-----------------
Used in tandem with testing is spaced repetition. As you may have guessed, spaced repetition is simply spacing out the practice of whatever it is you’re learning. You may have heard this tip before, but for some reason or another most students simply can’t execute on this advice. Whether it’s poor time management skills, a lack of motivation, or simple procrastination, most students find themselves cramming assignments or studying all at the last possible second. As mentioned previously though, cramming all of your material will leave you with vast memory gaps in only a week or two and have you scratching your head to remember the most fundamental ideas after six months or a year.

Spaced repetition is quite effective for improving long-term memory though. This stems mainly from its ability to interrupt the “forgetting curve”, a scientific name for something we all know: you forget things very quickly. By repetitively practicing material you subconsciously signal to your brain that the information is important and needs to be remembered. Naturally, you might ask how often you should be repeating information to which science, unfortunately, has no specific answer. The best answer is simply “until you feel you understand and remember it well enough.”

Implementing Spaced Repetition
------------------------------
As I’m sure you can tell though, “until you feel you understand and remember material well enough” is an extremely subjective assessment of your comprehension and provides you with no executable methods for spaced repetition (although testing can help with clarity here). I’m prone to think that at least five repetitions are necessary before claiming you know something but that’s simply an opinion. If you want more executable methods for using spaced repetition check out the retrospective revision timetable (great for information-heavy material such as biology, government, or business) or the method of three passes (great for critical thinking and problem-solving material such as math, engineering, or computer science).

Interleaving
------------
With active recall and spaced repetition under our belts, there’s one last tool that provides unique benefits in the world of effective learning. Interleaving, another fancy name for a simple concept, just means to switch up you’re learning. This tactic, as well as spaced repetition, is the antithesis to massed practice. While I could explain interleaving, an example provides the clearest and most concise route to understanding this tool.

Let’s pretend you’re in back in high school math class (fond memories I’m sure) and you’re trying to learn different parent functions (stick with me here). For your homework, you’re required to identify different parent functions such as linear, exponential, quadratic, cubic, square root, etc. One method would be to practice identifying only linear functions, then quadratic, then exponential, etc. This is massed practice — continually focusing on a single type of problem until feeling comfortable enough to move on to the next. On the other hand, interleaving would be to randomly practice all the functions so as to switch between identifying each type. Interleaving is more difficult, especially when applied to more complicated topics, but produces vastly better results.

The logic with interleaving is that it naturally produces high-level application skills. When practicing material, especially in the initial phases of learning, it’s quite difficult to match the proper solutions to corresponding problems when you don’t know what type of problem you’ll be receiving. Think of a batter trying to hit a baseball. It’s infinitely easier to hit the ball when you know what pitch is being thrown. In life though, and on your tests, you don’t know what pitch will be thrown. So, you’re throwing yourself under the bus when you mass your practice. Yes, you might know how to solve all the problems individually but without understanding the differences between the problems, which is developed through interleaving, you’ll have no idea when to apply different solutions, rendering your knowledge useless. This explains why interleaving is such a powerful tool for effective learning. It provides unique benefits in developing a high-level understanding of whatever you’re learning.
 
Don’t Take Notes, Take Questions
--------------------------------
Now that you’re armed with the general knowledge of the best and worst learning practices, a few side points are worth mentioning. The first of which is about taking notes. Frankly put, taking notes is a mid-tier learning tool.
For nearly any material you can find clean and concise notes on at least 80% of whatever it is you’re learning. Whether they’re your professor’s lecture slides, the textbook, or simply someone else’s notes online, I guarantee adequate notes can be found within five minutes (if not already provided to you). Thus, as a reference tool, note-taking is a waste of time; and as we’ve already established, rereading notes is also a waste of time. So what should you be using your notes for? To facilitate learning.

Stop trying to write everything down. With the advent of the internet, someone’s already done that for you. Instead, focus on the most important ideas and any unique points your professor makes (whether it be specific directions, an esoteric way to solve some problem, etc.). And if you’d like to make the most of your notes, use the Cornell Note format to create questions on the left side and notes on the right. In this way, you can simply cover the right side of your notes with a sheet of paper and use the questions you made on the left side as “flashcards” (a seamless method to implement active recall). Or if you’re a tech person you can use a flashcard application like ANKI or an integrated flashcard and note-taking software like RemNote. Whatever you choose though, I strongly recommend this approach of “taking questions” as opposed to taking notes.

A Note on Experience
--------------------
The last point I’d like to make, without going into too much detail, is that the adage “experience is the best teacher” not only holds true but could even be argued as the ultimate conglomeration of active recall, spaced repetition, and interleaving. Any way you can find to dive headfirst into what you’re learning (whether it be internships, clubs, personal projects, or simply connecting it to your own life) will improve your understanding tremendously.

Recap
-----
As a manner of providing some spaced repetition of what was covered in this article, here’s a quick recap.
The three most common learning mistakes are:
1.	Highlighting
2.	Rereading
3.	Massed Practice
These all require little to no energy or trick you into thinking you understand more than you do.
The three most effective learning practices are:
1.	Active recall
2.	Spaced Repetition
3.	Interleaving
These provide powerful learning tools to retain more of what you learn through some combination of increased difficulty, interrupting the forgetting curve, or providing high-level application skills to whatever is you’re learning.
