## I'll Start Tomorrow

I midly loathe New Year's Resolutions. The "Resolutions" part I'm cool with. By all means, go to the gym, improve your diet, strengthen your friendships, etc. 

My issue is the "New Year's" part of it. You shouldn't wait for arbitrary dates to make a change in your life. If every improvement in life had to wait for New Year's day, it'd take you a decade to figure out broccoli doesn't taste as bad as you thought (and another decade to actually start eating it).

I'm being hyperbolic of course. No one in February actually thinks "I want to start going to the gym but I need to prepare for the next 10 months... I'll start next year on January 1st". Okay, maybe *someone* has thought this, but certainly no one reading this (:wink).

Some time scales are more appealing than others though. It may be strikingly obvious that January 1st is an irrationally long time to postpone your marriage to the stairmaster. But what about March 1st? Or the beginning of next week? Or (my personal favorite) tomorrow?

I'll start tomorrow! How many times have a told myself that!

Tomorrow you will not a be a new man. You'll be the same as yesterday.

In fact, the entire premise of "one last time" is proof enough that you haven't decided to make an enduring change. If you had, you'd stop now. But you feel so bad about eating Wingstop *again*, you tell yourself a lie to feel better: I'll stop tomorrow.

The "One Last Time" fallacy typically applies to the removal of bad habits: smoking, wingstop, tequila, ex-girlfriends, etc.

When begininning new habits though, "starting tomorrow" is simply a procrastination technique. I can't 

Tomorrow, my friend, is where dreams go to die. If you want to make a change, don't start tomorrow. Start now.
